                <h1> SOME FACTS FOR COMPLEX NUMEBERS</h1>
                <ul>
                  <li>A complex number is a number in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers,<br> and i is the imaginary unit, which is defined as the square root of -1.</li>
                  <li>Complex numbers can be represented on the complex plane, <br>with the real part of the number represented on the x-axis and the imaginary part represented on the y-axis.</li>
                  <li>Complex numbers can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided using standard algebraic rules.</li>
                  <li>The conjugate of a complex number is obtained by changing the sign of its imaginary part.<br> The product of a complex number and its conjugate is always a real number.</li>
                  <li>The magnitude of a complex number is the distance from the origin to the point representing the number on the complex plane,<br> and is also known as the modulus of the number.</li>
                  <li>The argument of a complex number is the angle between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the origin to the point representing the number on the complex plane. It is also known as the phase or angle of the number.</li>
                  <li>Euler's formula states that for any complex number z, we have "z = r(cos(Î¸) + i sin(Î¸))", where r is the magnitude of z, and Î¸ is the argument of z.</li>

                       Reduced row echelon form example 
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Here is an example to illustrate the reduced row-echelon form of a matrix:<br>

                   <br> Consider the matrix:<br><br>
                    
                    [2 3 -1]<br>
                    [1 2  3]<br>
                    [4 3  2]<br>
                    
                    To put this matrix into reduced row-echelon form, we can perform the following steps:<br><br>
                    
                    Divide the first row by 2 to obtain [1 1.5 -0.5].<br><br>
                    Subtract the first row from the second row to obtain [0 0.5 3.5].<br><br>
                    Subtract 4 times the first row from the third row to obtain [0 -1 -6].<br><br>
                    Divide the second row by 0.5 to obtain [0 1 7].<br><br>
                    Subtract the second row from the third row to obtain [0 0 -13].<br><br>
                    The resulting matrix is in reduced row-echelon form:<br><br>
                    
                    [1 1.5 -0.5]<br>
                    [0 1      7]<br>
                    [0 0    -13]<br>

                <h1> RouchÃ©-Capelli theorem</h1>
                <p>  The RouchÃ©-Capelli theorem is a result from linear algebra that provides necessary and sufficient conditions for a system of linear equations to have a solution.<br> Specifically, the theorem states that a system of linear equations has a solution if and only if the rank of the coefficient matrix (the matrix formed by the coefficients of the variables in the system) is equal to the rank of the augmented matrix (the coefficient matrix with the constant terms from the equations appended to the right).

                    For example, consider the following system of equations:<br>
                    
                    2x + 3y = 4<br>
                    5x + 7y = 8<br>
                    
                    The coefficient matrix is:<br><br>
                    
                    [2 3]<br>
                    [5 7]<br>
                    
                    The augmented matrix is:<br><br>
                    
                    [2 3 4]<br>
                    [5 7 8]<br>
                    
                    The rank of the coefficient matrix is 2, and the rank of the augmented matrix is also 2. <br>Therefore, by the RouchÃ©-Capelli theorem, this system of equations has a solution.

                        <h1> Some notes for Base transformation</h1>

                        <p>Suppose we have the following matrix A expressed in the old base B:<br>
                                    <br>
                            A = [1 2]<br>
                                [3 4]<br>
                                <br>
                            And we want to change the base to a new base C:
                            <br>
                            C = [1 0]<br>
                                [0 1]<br>
                            
                            First, we express the columns of A in terms of C:
                            <br>
                            A = [1*1 + 2*0 1*0 + 2*1]<br>
                                      [3*1 + 4*0 3*0 + 4*1]<br>
                                   = [1 2]<br>
                                      [3 4]<br>
                            
                            Then, we express the new base vectors in terms of the old base:<br>
                            
                            C = [1*1 + 0*3 1*2 + 0*4]<br>
                                      [0*1 + 1*3 0*2 + 1*4]<br>
                                   = [1 2]<br>
                                      [3 4]<br>
                            
                            Now, we multiply A and C to get the matrix A transformed by the change of base:
                            <br>
                            A' = A * C = [1*1 + 2*3 1*2 + 2*4]<br>
                                          [3*1 + 4*3 3*2 + 4*4]<br>
                                       = [7 10]<br>
                                          [15 22]<br>
                            
                            Finally, we check our work by multiplying A' by the inverse of C:<br>
                            
                            A'' = A' * inv(C) = [7*1 + 10*3 7*2 + 10*4]<br>
                                                [15*1 + 22*3 15*2 + 22*4]<br>
                                            = [1 2]<br>
                                               [3 4]
                                               <br>
                            We can see that A'' is equal to the original matrix A, so our transformation was successful.
